# 🧍‍♂️ Pose Estimation with ViTPose 🧍‍♀️

Pose estimation is a powerful computer vision task focused on detecting and tracking **human body keypoints** (such as joints and limbs) from images or videos. 🧠📸  
It plays a crucial role in various domains such as:

- 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness & Training  
- 🕺 Animation & VFX  
- ⚽ Sports Analysis  
- 🧑‍⚕️ Healthcare  
- 🎮 Augmented Reality (AR)

## 🚀 What is ViTPose?

**ViTPose** is a cutting-edge model built on **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for high-precision human pose estimation.  
It follows a **top-down keypoint detection** approach:

1. 🎯 Detect human bounding boxes (via an external detector like RT-DETR).  
2. 🧩 Estimate keypoints for each detected person.

This focused strategy ensures **accurate detection** even in crowded scenes.  
ViTPose leverages the **transformer’s self-attention mechanism** to capture both global context and local details — resulting in superior performance.



## 🧪 What You'll Learn in This Notebook

🔍 **Step-by-step pipeline using ViTPose on images:**
1. 👁️ Detect humans with pre-trained **RT-DETR** from 🤗 Transformers.  
2. 🧠 Perform keypoint inference with **ViTPose**.  
3. 🖼️ Visualize results with keypoint overlays.



## 🎯 Why ViTPose?
